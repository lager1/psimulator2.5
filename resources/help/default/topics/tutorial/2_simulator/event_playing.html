            <h1>Event playing</h1>

            <h2>Playing captured events</h2>
            
            <p>Start playing with the <b>Play</b> button in <b>Control panel</b>:</p>
            <img src="../../../../images/play_button_selected.png" >
            
            <h3>Moving in the event list while playing</h3>
            
            <p>You can move in the event list as you want during playing. Use the previous, next, first and last buttons
                in <b>Play controls</b> panel, or use <b>mouse click</b> on table rows. </p>

            <img src="../../../../images/en/play_controls.png" >
            
            <h3>Speed setting</h3>
            
            <p>Playing speed can be set with a slider in <b>Play controls</b> panel. New speed will be 
                applied on next played event. Current animation wil finish in the original
                speed.</p>

            <h3>Sequential playing</h3>
            
            <p>You can play events <b>sequentially</b> (one by one). This mode will give you time to observe
                events. Duration of the animation depends on <b>speed</b> and <b>cable delay</b>.</p>

            <h3>Playing by timestamps</h3>
            
            <p>Events can be allso played in recieved times (timestamps). In this mode the animation duration
                depends on speed and cable delay, but there could be <b>more animations at a time</b>  
                because they were recieved in short time intervals.</p>

            <h2>Realtime mode</h2>
            
            <p>In <b>Realtime mode</b> packets are both <b>recieved</b> and <b>played</b>. Events are played 
                immediately when they are recieved. In this mode the duration of animation depends on speed 
                and cable delay. On the next image the realtime button is marked:</p>

            <h2>Capturing lost packets</h2>
            <p>Server sometimes make some packet disappear on purpose. Those events are 
                captured too. On the next image you can see those events in the
                event table.</p>

            <img src="../../../../images/en/event_list_with_lost_packets.png" >
            
            <h2>Screenshot of animation with lost packet</h2>
            
            <p>You can see animation of the lost pakcet on next screenshot:</p>
            
            <img src="../../../../images/lost_packet_visualization.png" >
            
            <h2>Screenshot of animation</h2>
            
            <p>Animation can look like this:</p>

            <h2>Changing the packet image</h2>
            
            <p>In application <b>Properties</b> you can change the packet image</p>
            
            <img src="../../../../images/en/packet_image_change.png" >
